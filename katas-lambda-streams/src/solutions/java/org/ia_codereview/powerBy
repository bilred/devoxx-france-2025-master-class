Hints and Tips

Review each Response and choose which one comes the closest to satisfying the prompt
If the prompt asks for code, the response must provide it
If a response generates code, you must ensure the code runs without errors
If there are errors in the code, use the comment feature to correct the code
The response must satisfy but not go beyond the Response Requirements listed above
The Response Requirements are more important than code functionality
Do not rewrite the function, only fix the errors
At the end, choose which Response is better, and justify your answer in the Assessment.txt file
Provide details describing why you chose that Response
Be mindful of your grammar
You may use Grammarly, but you may not use an LLM like ChatGPT
