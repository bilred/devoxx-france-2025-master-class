- How in Spring boot How configure multiple data source? do I need to implementing a custom DataSourceConfiguration class
- in java 8 with lambda I want to sort list of string base on length? without comparator

- With ConcurrentHashMap, I want to transform the keys to new collections, I WANT TO process only thoes meet the condition? How
forEachKey: Efficient for processing large maps, especially with parallelism.
forEach: Ideal when you need access to both keys and values.

- java 8, using lambda expretions, I have anonymous inner class that implments an interface with multiples methodes.
  What is the chalange with directly convrt to lambda?

It is used to represent a year and month (e.g., 2024-10), without a specific day, time, or timezone.

Coding test: Level Hard

check the Main class I have done during the test
But better solution will be to use the Jikstra algorithem insted the BSF

Here is the description of the coding test:
